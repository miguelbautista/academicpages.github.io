I am a Senior Research Scientist at Apple Inc. I was born in the beautiful island of Ibiza, Spain. I earned my Ph. D. in Error-Correcting Representations for
Multi-class problems at University of Barcelona. My main research interests lay in the intersection of Computer Vision
and Machine Learning, I am particularly interested in high-level problems (object recognition, pose estimation, action
recognition, etc.). I received my B. Sc. and M. Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from
University of Barcelona and BarcelonaTech in January and June 2010, respectively. In 2010 I was also the recipient of
the Catalan Association of Artificial Intelligence award. In 2013 I was a visitor at Carnegie Mellon University
(advised by Dr. Fernando De La Torre), working on Matrix Factorization methods for learning Error-Correcting Codes.
After earning my Ph. D. in 2015 I held a Postdoctoral Fellow position with the Heidelberg Collaboratory for Image Processing,
working on deep unsupervised methods for feature learning with Prof. Dr. Bjoern Ommer, publishing papers in ICCV, CVPR, NIPS & PAMI.
