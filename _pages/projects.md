* **Deep similarity learning**  
Learning similarities between images is a fundamental problem in Computer Vision and Image Analysis. I am interested in framing the problem of similarity learning within the Convolutional Neural Networks framework in order to learn transitivy properties over image similarities.

* **Human Pose Recovery using contextual representations**   
A major challenge for true AI to become a reality is to be able to interpret and understand humans and their interactions. In this sense, estimating the human pose in RGB images is a crucial task for further development in the field.

* **Error-Correcting Networks**  
Recent breakthrough in Convolutional Neural Networks have boosted the Computer Vision field enormously. However, like most supervised classification methods, they assume that different categories live in a equidistant label space. I am interested in studying which configurations of the label space are more suitable to further boost CNNs expressive properties.

* **Drivable surface detection**  
Autonomous driving is currently an extremely hot topic. However, autonomous driving systems (Tesla, Google, Apple, etc.) are based in very expensive sensor arrays (Lidar, GPS, laser arrays, etc.). I am interested in using unexpensive RGB images to model which areas of the landscape are drivable.

* **Computer Vision for Art-historical images (funded by Heidelberg Univerity - WinKolleg)**  
In this open we open a dialogue about artistic recognition and similarity, as well as, casestudies in a wide range of artisic productions which combines the two fields in the context of Computational Humanities
